## Overview

Welcome to the **SampleSite** repository – a showcase project for Ditadocs. This repository features a modern static site, a sample npm package, and utility scripts to streamline your development workflow.

### Purpose

This repository serves as a demonstration or starting point for constructing a website. It is commonly utilized to illustrate fundamental web development concepts or provide a pre-built framework for a rudimentary, static website.

### Potential Use Cases

- **Learning Tool:**  
  Suitable for beginners in web development seeking a practical example of a website’s structure.
- **Template/Starter Project:**  
  Can be forked or cloned as a base for personal projects, enabling developers to swiftly establish a site with a consistent layout and design.

---

## Repository Structure

### HTML Files

At its foundation, the repository likely comprises one or more HTML files (with an `index.html` as the entry point) that constitute the website’s skeleton.

### Styles and Scripts

Directories for CSS and JavaScript files may exist. These files handle website styling (e.g., layouts, colors, fonts) and any interactive functionalities.

### Assets

Folders for images, fonts, or other media utilized in the site may be included.

### Documentation

A README file is anticipated, providing an explanation of the project’s objectives, offering setup or deployment instructions, and detailing any dependencies or build processes.

---

## Technologies Involved

While the specific technologies are not explicitly mentioned, a sample website repository like this one is typically constructed utilizing:

- **HTML5:** For the organization of web pages.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** For basic interactivity or dynamic elements.

In certain instances, these projects may also demonstrate how to deploy a site using GitHub Pages, a widely adopted platform for hosting static websites directly from a GitHub repository.

---

## Usage

### Static Site

The static site is located in the `docs/` folder. You can preview it locally by opening the `docs/index.html` file in your browser:

- **macOS:**
  ```bash
  open docs/index.html
  ```
- **Linux:**
  ```bash
  xdg-open docs/index.html
  ```

Alternatively, view it directly via this link (if hosted on GitHub Pages or another platform): [Static Site Preview](#)

### ditadocs-weather Package

The `ditadocs-weather` package demonstrates how to integrate with the OpenWeatherMap API. For usage details and documentation, please see: [ditadocs-weather Package Documentation](#)

### Utility Scripts

A utility script (`update_scripts.sh`) is provided to update shell scripts within the repository. To run the update script:

1. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/update_scripts.sh
   ```
2. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/update_scripts.sh
   ```

---

## Development & Build Process

Consider adding build tasks such as minification, asset bundling, or a static site generator.

### Continuous Integration

Set up CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing, linting, and deployment.

### Code Quality

Ensure code quality by using linters and formatters.
